In CBC, shuffled list is created. First, the plaintext is converted into binary from the program 1.4. Then the key of size 24 bit is subdivided into 12 bit string. Further, check the length of the text should be a factor of 16. The data is divided into blocks of 16. The first block is exored with the shuffled array and added to the cipher.
